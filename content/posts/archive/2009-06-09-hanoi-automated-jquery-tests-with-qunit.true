<p>About a month ago, we have released <a href="http://adva-cms.org">adva-cms</a> 0.2.0, the <a href="http://adva-cms.org/2009/4/28/out-now-adva-cms-0-dot-2-0-the-usability-release">most relevant change</a> was the migration from <a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</a> to <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>. I always been a loyal Prototype fan, and, until then, I always tested my code with `unittest.js`, combined with `jstest.rb`.


Like other rewrite we needed to rely on a solid test layer, but what I noticed was the lack of a valid automation support for **QUnit**, the test framework used internally by the jQuery team. So, in a couple of days I built what we need, just creating a custom version of `jstest.rb` and changing a little bit QUnit, in order to communicate with it.


Now I extracted a the general purpose code for testing other JavaScript projects, the result is <strong><a href="http://github.com/jodosha/hanoi">Hanoi</a></strong>.


Hanoi needs a working <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">Rake</a> installation and it&#8217;s capable to test your JavaScript code, <strong>collecting the results inside the shell</strong>. It currently supports <strong>assets</strong>, and <strong>fixtures</strong>, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to use.


First of all you need to install the gem:<br/><code class="bash">
(sudo) gem install jodosha-hanoi -s <a href="http://gems.github.com">http://gems.github.com</a>
</code>


Then you have to initialize your project path, with the `hanoi` executable:<br/><code class="bash">
hanoi /path/to/project
</code>


Now, you can easily run the test suite:<br/><code class="bash">
rake test:js
</code>


You can find more details on the <a href="http://github.com/jodosha/hanoi">GitHub</a> page.</p>
