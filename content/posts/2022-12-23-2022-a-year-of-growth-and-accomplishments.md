It's been a **busy and rewarding year**, both personally and professionally.

**I turned 40 in June**! That was an opportunity to think about time passing. I'm committed to spending time doing the things I always wanted to do but never took the courage to do.

For example, I started taking **swimming lessons**. üèä For a person that was terrified by deep water, it's a vast improvement. üí™

Another exciting news was to **start playing live electronic music**. üéß
It happened a few times, and that was fun! A lot of fun! üòé

Still, on the music side, I published **[32 new songs](https://www.instagram.com/jodosha/)** varying from 1 to 6 mins.

My football team (Salernitana) made a [historical sports miracle by **escaping relegation**](https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/serie-a-walter-sabatini-the-man-behind-salernitanas-great-escape-from-relegation/) on the last match of Serie A (italian football league).

We started 2022 with COVID-19 restrictions, and now we can return to "normal life." I got sick myself in October.

More importantly, **I spent a year with my loved ones**. I never take it for granted. That's why I'm so grateful for it.

In my professional life, I've had the opportunity to take on **exciting new projects and responsibilities**. I've expanded my skills and knowledge as a software architect at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com) and have had the chance to work with some talented and supportive colleagues.

The most significant achievement this year has been the **[launch of Hanami 2.0](https://hanamirb.org/blog/2022/11/22/announcing-hanami-200/)**. An Open Source Ruby framework that wouldn't have been possible without the [talented team](https://github.com/hanami) behind it.

Overall, it's been a great year full of personal and professional growth. I'm excited to see what new challenges and opportunities come my way the next year.

I am looking forward to a great 2023!
