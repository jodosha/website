<p><strong>Little Miss Sunshine</strong> has won <strong>two</strong> oscars!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy, I have watched this movie just a week ago, and I like it.
It&#8217;s a nice story about an odd american family that cross the US aboard an old volksvagen van. It&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s sad, it&#8217;s sweet. You have to see it.</p>
