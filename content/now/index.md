### Job

I'm working at [Toptal](https://toptal.com) as Backend Architect. With my team, we envision and execute the SOA architecture of the company.

Currently, I'm overviewing initiatives that involve large SOA service extraction from a Ruby on Rails monolith, company public pages, and advanced usage of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with a [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/).

Reading more than the past. Topics are about software architecture processes.

### Open Source

**Hanami 2.0** looks great, we count to release a new alpha during Q2 2021.

Read more about it in my latest [Open Source update](/2021/04/12/open-source-updates-q1-2021/)

### Personal

Meditating a few times per week.

Studying stoicism.

I'm learning how to ~~techno~~ electronic music.
The learning process is made of discovery, limiting to a single genre doesn't allow a 360 growth.
