### My Work

I'm working hard **every day for 15 years** to keep Ruby Community vibrant.

That includes speak at [**conferences**](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=luca+guidi+ruby), create [**screencasts**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAprzjCQpYdzyN9Bv-Iq1sA), write [**blog posts**](/), and play a role in [**Open Source**](https://github.com/jodosha).

During these years, I contributed to several important Open Source projects like [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack), [redis-rb](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb), [lego](https://github.com/go-acme/lego), and created my own: [Hanami](https://github.com/hanami) and [redis-store](https://github.com/redis-store).
I'm in the [dry-rb](https://github.com/dry-rb) core team as well.

I'm currently working on [Hanami 2](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/issues/1067) and [Hanami::API 1](https://github.com/hanami/api). ðŸŒ¸
