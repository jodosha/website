As a software architect who has worked in Agile environments for several years, I have seen the benefits of the Agile Manifesto's emphasis on "people over processes."

However, there is also value in challenging this principle and considering the potential drawbacks of prioritizing people over processes in certain situations.

One of the main arguments for prioritizing people over processes is that it allows for more flexibility and adaptability in the development process. By focusing on team members' individual talents and skills, Agile teams can respond quickly to changes and challenges as they arise. This approach can be especially beneficial in fast-paced industries where the market and technology constantly evolve.

Prioritizing people over processes can also have its drawbacks. 

For example, without transparent processes, teams may struggle to maintain consistency and accountability. This context can lead to confusion and miscommunication, ultimately hindering the team's ability to deliver high-quality work on time.

The Agile Manifesto's emphasis on "people over processes" can be challenging to maintain in large organizations, particularly when it comes to ensuring consistency across teams. Without a common framework, teams may become siloed and focused on their objectives rather than working together to support the organization.

With transparent processes in place, teams may be able to coordinate and align their work, achieving consistency in the organization's overall performance.

In conclusion, while the Agile Manifesto's emphasis on "people over processes" has many benefits, it can be challenging to maintain in large organizations. To ensure consistency and alignment across teams, large organizations must strike a balance between prioritizing people and processes. By doing so, they can benefit from the flexibility and adaptability of the Agile approach while ensuring that their teams work towards the organization's overall goals and objectives.
